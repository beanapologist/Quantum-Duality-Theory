# Quantum Duality Theory (QDT)

A theoretical framework exploring the intersection of quantum mechanics and gravitational effects through a novel dual-scale approach.

## Overview

Quantum Duality Theory (QDT) proposes a unified approach to understanding quantum-gravitational interactions through the lens of scale-dependent behavior and time-mediated transitions. The theory introduces novel mathematical constructs to bridge the gap between quantum and classical regimes.

## Core Components

### 1. Time Mediation Function κ(t)
- Exhibits prime-modulated oscillations
- Features exponential damping envelope
- Controls temporal evolution of quantum-classical transitions

### 2. Scale Coupling Parameter λ(t)
- Defines transition between quantum (λ=0) and classical (λ=1) regimes
- Identifies critical transition point t_c
- Facilitates smooth scale transitions

### 3. Energy Flow Phase Space
- Maps interaction between quantum tunneling (T_q) and gravitational funneling (F_g)
- Demonstrates dynamic equilibrium between scales
- Preserves conservation principles

### 4. Conservation Laws
- Maintains total energy conservation within numerical bounds
- Accounts for local fluctuations while preserving global invariants
- Provides mathematical consistency checks
